# LocalGlobalDecompositions

When the paper is published, this repository will contain research code for generation and training of the generative models proposed in Robertson et al.'s "Local-Global Decompositions for Conditional Microstructure Generation".

However, this code is definitely "research code". It was developed during the research process and, as a result, is rather messy. As a result, we also direct the interested reader to "https://github.com/arobertson38/DiffusionGeneration" for a cleaner version which is under will be continually improved. This second respository will also be made public when the paper is published. 


The following are brief explanations of the contexts of each folder. 
If the following is insufficient, please contact us at:
Andreas E. Robertson: arobertson38@gatech.edu

TrainingFramework: This folder -- perhaps unsurprisingly -- contains the training framework for the proposed models. 
    (1) configs: a folder containing the config files. The 'baseline' config files are stored in the BASELINES subfolder. 
                 These are config files that the configwriter draws from to sweep a large range of parameters. 
    (2) models: a folder containing various model forms.
