# LocalGlobalDecompositions

When the paper is published, this repository will contain research code for generation and training of the generative models proposed in Robertson et al.'s "Local-Global Decompositions for Conditional Microstructure Generation".

However, this code is definitely "research code". It was developed during the research process and, as a result, is rather messy. As a result, we also direct the interested reader to "https://github.com/arobertson38/DiffusionGeneration" for a cleaner version which is under will be continually improved. This second respository will also be made public when the paper is published.
