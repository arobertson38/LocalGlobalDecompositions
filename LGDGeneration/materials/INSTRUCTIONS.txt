Future Viewer,

The subfolder of this folder contain the original
microstructures and the trained models that were extracted
from them. 

Each folder contains four files:

    (1) reference.pth -- this is the original microstructure stored
                         as a torch tensor. 
    (2) checkpoint.pth -- this is the saved model without EMA/SWA. 
    (3) swa_checkpoint.pth -- this is the saved EMA/SWA model. 
    (4) config.yml -- this is the config file used to generate these
                      microstructures. I apologize that it is less
                      cleaned up than the config files in training. 

In both Case Studies, we utilized the swa model:
'swa_checkpoint.pth'. 

Good luck,

Andreas
